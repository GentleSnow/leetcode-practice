## 371. Sum of Two Integers


1. Set union A | B
2. Set intersection A & B
3. Set subtraction A & ~B
4. Set negation ALL_BITS ^ A or ~A
5. Set bit A |= 1 << bit
6. Clear bit A &= ~(1 << bit)
7. Test bit (A & 1 << bit) != 0
8. Extract last bit A&-A or A&~(A-1) or x^(x&(x-1))
9. Remove last bit A&(A-1)
10. Get all 1-bits ~0


### Solution 1: bit

Runtime: 32ms

```Python
class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        if a == 0:
            return b
        if b == 0:
            return a     
        mask = 0xffffffff
        # in Python, every integer is associated with its two's complement and its sign.
        # However, doing bit operation "& mask" loses the track of sign.
        # Therefore, after the while loop, a is the two's complement of the final result as a 32-bit unsigned integer.
        while b != 0:
            a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask

        # a is negative if the first bit is 1
        if (a >> 31) & 1:
            return ~(a ^ mask)
        else:
            return a
